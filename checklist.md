## 1. Install Visual Studio Code
1. Download and install from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Open VS Code and install the **Python extension by Microsoft** from the Extensions marketplace
3. If you have GitHub Copilot installed, **disable it immediately**

## 2. Install Git

### Important: AI Tool Usage Policy

#### ✅ Chat Agents (ALLOWED)
**Examples:** Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.

Chat agents are excellent learning tools. You can use them to:
- Understand programming concepts and theory
- Review and analyze your code
- Get explanations of how code works
- Ask questions about programming, problem solving

Chat agents respond to your questions but don't directly modify your files.

#### ❌ Coding Agents (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN)
**Examples:** GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, GitHub Codex, Cursor AI, etc.

Coding agents are prohibited, they:
- Automatically create and modify files
- Write code for you autonomously
- Become intrusive and make it difficult to track what's happening
- Quickly get out of control in complex projects
- Prevent you from learning fundamental programming skills

**As demonstrated in class, coding agents must be avoided at all costs.**
